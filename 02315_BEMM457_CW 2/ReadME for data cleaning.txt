 Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline for Video Game Sales Dataset

 Overview
This script outlines the steps taken to clean and preprocess the "Video Game Sales" dataset, ensuring it is ready for advanced analytics and machine learning tasks. Below is a detailed explanation of each step:

 Steps in the Pipeline

 1. Handling Missing Values
   - Critical columns like `Year` and `Publisher` are essential for analysis.
   - Action Taken: Rows with missing values in these columns were removed.

 2. Validating the `Year` Column
   - Only records with a valid release year (1980â€“2023) were retained.
   - Action Taken: Rows with years outside this range were removed.

 3. Removing Duplicate Records
   - Duplicate records can skew analysis.
   - Action Taken: Exact duplicates were identified and removed.

 4. Fixing Unrealistic Sales Data
   - Ensures the sum of regional sales (`NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`) does not exceed the `Global_Sales` value.
   - Action Taken: Rows failing this logical check were excluded.

 5. Handling Outliers in `Global_Sales`
   - Extreme values in `Global_Sales` were removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
   - Action Taken: Values outside the range `[Q1 - 1.5IQR, Q3 + 1.5IQR]` were removed.

 6. Grouping Rare Categories
   - Categories with fewer than 10 occurrences in `Platform` and `Genre` were grouped into an "Other" category.
   - Action Taken: Merged infrequent categories to reduce noise in the analysis.

 7. Encoding Categorical Variables
   - Categorical variables such as `Platform` and `Genre` were transformed using one-hot encoding to prepare them for machine learning algorithms.
   - Action Taken: Used `OneHotEncoder` to create binary columns for each category.

 8. Scaling Numerical Columns
   - Sales data (`NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`, `Global_Sales`) was standardized for better comparability across regions.
   - Action Taken: Applied `StandardScaler` to scale all sales-related columns.

 9. Rounding Sales Columns
   - Sales values were rounded to 2 decimal places for clarity and consistency.
   - Action Taken: Rounded all original sales columns (`NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, etc.).

 10. Saving the Cleaned Dataset
   - Final cleaned and processed data was saved as `vgsales_cleaned.csv`.
   - Action Taken: The cleaned dataset includes encoded categorical features and scaled numerical columns, with original sales columns removed.

 Summary of Cleaning
The cleaned dataset is:
1. Free of duplicates and missing values.
2. Scaled for numerical consistency.
3. Encoded for categorical analysis.
4. Ready for machine learning and statistical exploration.
